Pipeline :



> Camera calibration
	FOV
	Radial distortion
		Not needed here, since all the input testing data will be 3D generated, so perfect camera

> 3D model generation
	Object in center of the camera

	> Hierarchical view generation
		Define max view boundaries (d, omega, phi)
		Generate equally distributed camera positions

		For each pyramid level :
			Oversample views around each point
			For each group of cameras, compute similarity metric
			Pairs with highest similarity are merged
			Repeat until similarity < threshold
			
			Save the remaining views in pyramid
			For level 2+ : Save the child views references (Tree structure)
			-> used for refining

			Then: repeat on lower resolution render
				-> lower resolution = higher inplace similarity

			
	> Model image generation
		For each level, view in Tree :
			Orientate camera on object
			[ Similarity measure (c) robust to occlusion, clutter and non-linear contrast change
			Extract normals n = (x, y, z)
			Render each face with color = (x, y, z) normalized

			For normals 1, 2 :
				Compute color tensor C
				Edge amplitude A = eig(C) = sqrt(SUM(i1 - i2)², i in [x, y, z]
				Angle between 2 normals delta = 2arcsin(A/2)

			Filter edges with angle threshold

			Save all infos (pose, angle) in tree

> 3D object recognition
	Start at hisghest pyramid level
	Try to find the 2D matching model using similarity meeasure c
		Rot scale in range steps
		2D pose matches -> stored as candidates

	N-1 level
		Poses without parent are searched, and children of previous

	Apply homography (disto from camera center)
		Possibly precomputed

> Pose refinement
	Will see if done


> Evaluation
